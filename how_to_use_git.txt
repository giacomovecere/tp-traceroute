git commit -a 
and then insert the message (actually it should be a title, a break line and the specific text about what it has done).
It both adds and commit the files (if they are not new files)

if you want add some files you have to use:
git add <file_name>

git push 

git pull for updating the files in your local repository


For developing a new feature is good to make a new branch (so the master branch is not affected to some mistakes):
git branch <new_feature>	for creating the new branch
git checkout <new_feature>   	for going into the new branch

git checkout master		for going back into the master branch

git merge <branch>		merge the specified branch into the current branch
